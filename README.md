# GoF_DPs_Java_Examples
This repository is a collection of Java examples for the GoF Design Patterns.
These examples are made in a way to be easy to understand how design patterns work and how they can be implemented in different ways. 

GoF Design Patterns are divided into three categories:
Creational: The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.
Structural: The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure such as Inheritance and Composition.
Behavioral: This type of design patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects, how to provide lose coupling, and flexibility to extend easily in future.
